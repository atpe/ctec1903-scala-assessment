# CTEC 1903 - Computer Programming II Assignment

## Deliverables

You are required to complete the implementation of the simple game library: Game.scala. The specification of each of the operations is provided as comments within the skeleton code so please take time to read the supplied library carefully before you start. You may complete as many of the operations as you wish.
You will be provided with a JUnit test case in which there are 50-unit tests. You can use this to test your functions incrementally. 

## Assesment

The markers will run your library against the published JUnit tests and allocate a mark based upon how many tests are passed. Therefore, normally, the greater the number of operations you complete successfully, the higher the mark will be. You do not need to hand in the JUnit test cases because we will be using the original JUnit test case file (i.e. GameTest.scala).
Note that initially some of the unit tests already pass even with no implementation. This is because they are testing, e.g., certain boundary conditions which are initially true. However, there is no guarantee that these tests will still pass once you start coding them. They will, of course, if you code them correctly.
The markers will view your source code to check that you have made a reasonable attempt at the operations and reserve the right to adjust the final mark accordingly. (Therefore, leaving all the methods as unimplemented in order to pick up free marks will not be a successful strategy!)
